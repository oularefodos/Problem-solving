You should calculate a count of natural numbers not greater than n and divisible at least by one of k given primes.
For example, you are given:
n = 25
k = 2
p = {2, 5}
The numbers are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25.
The answer is 15


Constraints
1<=n<=10**13
1<=k<=10
2<=p_i<40
